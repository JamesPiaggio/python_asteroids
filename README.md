# Python Asteroids

A clone of the classic Asteroids game using Pygame and object-oriented programming concepts.

# What it does
A Python-based application built as part of Boot.dev coursework to practice using object-oriented programming to create game objects and manage their interactions. You use WASD to move the Player object and the spacebar to shoot asteroids. If you collide with an asteroid, the program ends.
